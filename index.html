                2022, at a qualifying location. Offer subject to availability. While supplies last. Customers shall
                receive a discount equal to the value of the Promotion Product (depending on their purchase) off the
                price of the Eligible Product, but will be charged for all items in their cart. Important notice
                regarding the checkout receipt and monthly statement for Apple Card Monthly Installment (ACMI) purchases
                with this promotion: A purchase of an Eligible Product made when selecting ACMI (a 0% APR payment option
                available only in the U.S.) as the payment type at checkout will receive an instant credit equal to the
                cost of the Promotion Product (Apple Gift Card) deducted from the price of the Eligible Product at the
                time of purchase. You will be charged one ACMI installment plan for the Eligible Product discounted by
                the instant credit. The value of the Promotion Product (i.e. the value of the Apple
                Gift Card) will also be charged in a separate second ACMI installment plan for the same
                number of months as the discounted Eligible Product. The total combined amount charged over the 2
                separate ACMI installment plans will reflect the original full retail price of the Eligible Product.
                Separately, you will receive and be charged for the Promotion Product (Apple Gift Card) in the amount
                of the applicable instant credit. ACMI is subject to credit approval and credit limit. Variable APRs for

                choosing ACMI as the payment option at checkout, that purchase will be subject to the variable APR
                assigned to your Apple Card. Taxes and shipping are not included in ACMI transactions and are subject to
